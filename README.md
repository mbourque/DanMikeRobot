An open source Surgical Robotic system

Ever since my pal Daniel sent me a surgical robot part, I have been researching robotic surgery systems and the technology and kinematics behind it. Itâ€™s extremely cool technology, expensive as heck, and an incredible engineering marvel that saves lives.

But what if the technology could be used for other purposes? What if it was affordable and open source so anyone could 3d print, build, and extend a robotic surgical platform?

Sound cool right? Welcome to DanMike Robitics!
